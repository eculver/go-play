# tdtepisode - Podcast publishing tools for TheDrunkenTaoist.com

## Workflow

Before any of the publishing can take place, these things must have already taken place:

- Episode has been recorded & edited
- Episode media has been uploaded to Wiredrive
- Daniele has written the episode notes and emailed them to me

The process of publishing a new episode goes something like: 

- Download notes and image from email
- Download media from Wiredrive
- Upload image to Wiredrive
- Upload media to CDN
- Convert the notes to plaintext
- Create episode HTML
- Publish draft of episode to site
- Email Daniele to review
- Daniele and I have back-and-forth to adjust if necessary
- Daniele approves
- Publish episode

This tool assists in the process by automating as much as possible.
